# topotoga
crowdfunded auctions - wouldn't you like to win?

### What is topotoga?

Topotoga is an app that uses crowdfunding and gamification mechanics to host and help cwrodfund lottery/auction events, with the filosophy that the pie is big enough for everyone to take a pieze. The seller the bidders and the prize winner are all compensated in some way. Hence the term "todos ponen todos ganan" wich is spanish for everybody pitches in, everybody wins. 

### How the game works

Stage 01: The crowdfunding of the event
The seller post a lottery event, poeple fund it by buying tickets to participate in the bidding. Once enough tickets have been sold, the saller gets his money and a prized ticket is generated randomely. If not enough tickets were sold, everyone who bought a ticket gets their money back. Once the event has been crowdfunded, the seller gets his money, he can pitch in a % to stimulate the bidding in exchange he will get a % (proportional to the amount pitched in) from the common pool (money generated from the players bids).  

Stage 02: The Lottery 
A winning ticket is generated at randome, and all the players who funded the event get assigned a turn based on their position to the winning prize ticket.

Stage 03: The Auction
The auction has 3 rounds, where each player gets a chanze to bid for the winning prize ticket. They can't bid for the winning prize from the get-go (BLUE SLOT), they have to bid the ticket next to them untill they get close enough to the winning ticket, to bid for the winning prize (BLUE SLOT). 50% of the bidding money goes to the common pool and the other 50% goes to the player that traded his ticket. At the end of each round the common pool is split evenly amoungs all the players. At the end of the thord round the player who has the winning ticket (BLUE) takes the prize and the rest take the amount of money thet generated from trading their tickets amoungs each other.

Example:

Supose you are the player 5 (ORANGE) You want the player 1's ticket. You can't just offer the player one (BLUE) directly for his ticket, you have to bid for the ticket next to you from the PLayer 4 (PURPLE). You have to make him an offer and if he accepts he will trade you his ticket for yours. Now you will have the purple ticket and he will have the orange ticket. If you trade the ticket from player 4 (GREEN) and the trade the ticke from player 2 (YELLOW) now you can bid player 1 (BLUE) for the winning ticket. 

It allows the seller to take it at a premium, the buyer to take it at a super bargain, and the people who pitched in to make a profit.
